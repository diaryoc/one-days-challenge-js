The Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) problem is finding the longest subsequence present in given two sequences in the same order, i.e.,
find the longest sequence which can be obtained from the first original sequence by deleting some items and
from the second original sequence by deleting other items.

The problem differs from the problem of finding the longest common substring.
Unlike substrings, subsequences are not required to occupy consecutive positions within the original string.

For example, consider the two following sequences, X and Y:

X: ABCBDAB
Y: BDCABA

The length of the LCS is 4LCS are BDAB, BCAB, and BCBA
